4)Feedback:

The challenge for the project is to find the data inflection point to arrange staff appropriately. I would explain it in more detail.

You need to consider both the normal working hours and session condition.

For example, during 18-20p.m, there may be have similar number of website sessions as in the normal working hour 9a.m-17 p.m. My way to solve the issue is communicate with relevant frontline staff to understand their affordable workload, and customer conversion rate.
